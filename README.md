Abstract: Images are a key element in remote sensing target detection, and rainy weather can affect the quality of images captured by unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing equipment, further affecting the application of remote sensing technology. Therefore, single image-deraining (SID) has drawn widespread attention. The work in this paper fully coordinates and utilizes the advantages between CNN and SA, and proposes an effective content-aware denoising network (CAD) to reduce complexity and generate high-quality denoising results. Specifically, we construct the CADBlock, including the content-aware convolution and attention mixer module (CAMM) and the multi-scale double-gated feed-forward module (MDFM). In CAMM, the attention mechanism is used for intricate windows to generate abundant features, and simple convolution is used for plain windows to reduce computational costs. In MDFM, multi-scale spatial features are fused double-gated to preserve local detail features and enhance image restoration capabilities. Furthermore, a four tokens contextual attention module (FTCA) is introduced to explore the content information among neighbor keys to improve the representation ability of the network. Both qualitative and quantitative validations on synthetic and real-world rain images demonstrate that the proposed CAD can achieve a competitive deraining performance.
